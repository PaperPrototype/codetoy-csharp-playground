# Codetoy CSharp Playground

> [!NOTE]
> Any C code or dll files are auto generated by dotnet build and do not represent any handwritten interop code.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a work in progress. At this very moment the only thing this does is serve as a starting point for using C# with sveltekit

A fully featured C# playground with access to [CanvasRenderingContext2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D) and basic browser input events

### Running

Build the C# code

```sh
npm run build:dotnet # build C# code -> src/libs/dotnet
npm install # install sveltekit libs
npm run dev # run app
```

Or with pnpm

```sh
pnpm run build:dotnet
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

### How it works

Contains a .NET 7.0 project in the `dotnet` folder. When compiling the C# project uses the `<WasmAppDir>../src/lib/dotnet</WasmAppDir>` to put the wasm files into your lib folder.

### As a library

This is a sveltekit library project. See relevant docs for more info [Sveltekit Packaging Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/packaging). Once it reaches maturity and has successfully achieved it's goal of making a full C# playground in the browser it can be published as an open source library on npm.

### Resources

The documentation for getting a csharp compiler in the browser is very lacking but here is a non-comprehensive list of the resources I managed to get my hands on:

- https://github.com/maraf/dotnet-wasm-react (a basic example setup that I used to get this repo working, does not include browser based C# compilation)
- https://github.com/PaperPrototype/wulferis-wasm-csharp-compiler (big thanks to @wulferis)
- https://github.com/JakeYallop/WasmSharp
- A simple raytracer built with html canvas and C# https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/0d20f9ad3e0fd58a510062757b34f76a3c122b25/src/mono/sample/wasm/simple-raytracer/main.js
